  .SYNOPSIS
  Tests to see if a specified database exists.

  .DESCRIPTION
  Takes the name of the passed in database and runs a query against the master
  database to see if the passed in database exists. 

  Note the user executing the query must have permissions to execute a read 
  only query against the master database.
  
  .INPUTS
  PodcastDatabaseName - The name of the database to create. If omitted, the
  company standard name of 'PodcastSight' is used.
  
  .OUTPUTS
  $true if the database exists, $false otherwise.
  
  .EXAMPLE
  $result = Test-PodcastDatabase 'PodcastSight'

  .EXAMPLE
  $result = Test-PodcastDatabase -PodcastDatabaseName 'PodcastSight'

  .EXAMPLE
  $result = Test-PodcastDatabase 
  
#>
function Test-PodcastDatabase()
{ 
  [CmdletBinding()]
  param
  (
    [parameter (Mandatory = $false) ]
    $PodcastDatabaseName = 'PodcastSight'
  )

  Write-Verbose "Test-PodcastDatabase..: Testing for database $PodcastDatabaseName"


  # Testing is done on the server running SQL Server

  <#
     Note you might think you could do something like:
       $machine = $env:COMPUTERNAME
       $path = "SQLServer:\SQL\$machine\default\databases\$PodcastDatabaseName"
       $return = Test-Path $path
     
     Unfortunately there is a timing issue. If you do a New-PodcastDatabase 
     (for example) and immediately check the results using the above method,
     the SQL Provider may not have time to refresh and thus report the 
     database as existing. 

     Therefore we need to query the server directly and see if it is there.

    SELECT COUNT(*) AS DbExists

  # At PodcastSight, all SQL Servers are setup with default as the instance
  # Thus we can just use the computer name as the server instance, which will
