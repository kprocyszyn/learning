Use Case: 
·         A database upgrade requires the execution of numbered scripts stored in a specified folder, e.g. SQL scripts such as 045.createtable.sql.
·         There may be gaps in the numbering and there isn't always a . (dot) after the number. 
·         The database upgrade is based on looking up the current version in the database and comparing this number to the numbers in the script names. 
·         If the version number from the db matches the highest number from the script then nothing is executed. 
·         If the number from the db is lower than the highest number from the scripts, then all scripts that contain a higher number than the db will be executed against the database. 
·         In addition, the database version table is updated after the install with the highest number. 
  
Requirements:
•	Supported Languages: Bash, Python2.7, PHP, Shell, Ruby, Powershell - No other languages will be accepted
•	The table where the version is stored is called 'versionTable', and the row with the version is 'version'. This table contains only one column with the actual version.
•	You will have to use a MySQL database
•	The information about the database and the directory will be passed through arguments, following this format
o	<directory with .sql scripts> <username for the DB> <DB host> <DB name> <DB password>
